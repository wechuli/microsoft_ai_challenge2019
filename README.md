# Microsoft AI Challenge 2019

## The Challenge

Azure AI puts artificial intelligence and machine learning at the fingertips of every developer. Want to build ML models? Choose between visual, automated, and code-first interfaces that simplify machine learning for any experience level. Want to use pre-built models? Infuse computer vision, natural language processing, and decision-making capabilities into your apps with simple API calls.

Put your skills to the test and apply Azure AI to a new or existing project! We welcome projects of all types, including AI-powered apps or devices, conversational bots, ML models, or something else entirely! 

Use one or more of following Azure AI services to build a new project or update an existing project: Azure Machine Learning service, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Search. Projects may integrate with other Azure services, open source technologies (including but not limited to frameworks, libraries, and APIs) and physical hardware of your choice.
